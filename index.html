    <h1>Tables(information)</h1>
      <p>A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs, and many other places. The precise conventions and terminology for describing tables vary depending on the context. Further, tables differ significantly in variety, structure, flexibility, notation, representation and use. In books and technical articles, tables are typically presented apart from the main text in numbered and captioned floating blocks.</p>

    <h2>Specific uses</h2>
      <p>There are several specific situations in which tables are routinely used as a matter of custom or formal convention.</p>

    <h3>Publishing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cross-reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents" target="_blank">(Table of contents)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/Table_of_Contents_PANARCHIE_published_in_1860.jpg" alt="Table_of_contents" width="400px" height="450px">
      <p>A table of contents, usually headed simply Contents and abbreviated informally as TOC, is a list, usually found on a page before the start of a written work, of its chapter or section titles or brief descriptions with their commencing page numbers.</p>

    <h3>Mathematics</h3>

      <p>In mathematics, a multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for an algebraic system.</p>

      <ul>

      <p>A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables (Enderton, 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, logically valid.</p>

    <h3>Natural sciences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chemistry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" target="_blank">(Periodic table)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/1205px-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg.png" alt="Periodic_table" width="500px" height="450px">
      <p>The periodic table, or periodic table of elements, is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties, whose structure shows periodic trends. Generally, within one row (period) the elements are metals to the left, and non-metals to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called periods and columns are called groups. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.</p>

        <li>Oceanography <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_table" target="_blank">(tide table)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <img src="images/800px-Tide_table_01.jpg" alt="Tide_table" width="400px" height="450px">
      <p>Tide tables, sometimes called tide charts, are used for tidal prediction and show the daily times and levels of high and low tides, usually for a particular location. Tide heights at intermediate times (between high and low water) can be approximated by using the rule of twelfths or more accurately calculated by using a published tidal curve for the location. Tide levels are typically given relative to
      a low-water datum, e.g. the mean lower low water (MLLW) datum in the US.</p>

    <h2>Information technology</h2>
    <h3>Software applications</h3>
      <p>Modern software applications give users the ability to generate, format, and edit tables and tabular data for a wide variety of uses, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>word processing applications;</li>
        <li>spreadsheet applications;</li>
        <li>presentation software;</li>
        <li>tables specified in HTML or another markup language</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Software development</h3>
      <p>Tables have uses in software development for both high-level specification and low-level implementation. Usage in software specification can encompass ad hoc inclusion of simple decision tables in textual documents through to the use of tabular specification methodologies, examples of which include SCR and Statestep. Proponents of tabular techniques, among whom David Parnas is prominent, emphasize their understandability, as well as the quality and cost advantages of a format allowing systematic inspection, while corresponding shortcomings experienced with a graphical notation were cited in motivating the development of at least two tabular approaches.</p>
      <p>At a programming level, software may be implemented using constructs generally represented or understood as tabular, whether to store data (perhaps to memoize earlier results), for example, in arrays or hash tables, or control tables determining the flow of program execution in response to various events or inputs.</p>

    <h3>Databases</h3>
      <p>Database systems often store data in structures called tables; in which columns are data fields and rows represent data records.</p>
